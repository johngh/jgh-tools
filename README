These are tools I use to make life easier working on Linux & Unix machines.

backup - 
    backs up the filenames supplied to copies which include the
    original file's timestamp in their name.

get-dir
    get-dir / gd - a simple way of jumping around dirs you use all the time

    Put this in your path as get-dir
    add the section at the bottom to your .bashrc
    and call it with:

        $ gd

    or:

        $ gd [DIR_TAG]

    It's nice to have this with it too:

magic

new
    skeleton code for new Perl program

    Template for a new Perl program - outputs commonly used skeleton code to save typing it again.

    Usage:
    new [-h] [-d] [-f] [-n]
    where:
      -h - skip header (hash bang, warnings & strictness pragmas)
      -d - code for reading a directory (from perldoc -f readdir)
      -f - code for reading a file.
      -n - Perl 5.6 or newer lexical filehandles (defaults to old Perl TYPEGLOB)

    This saves you retyping it, making a typo, and makes sure you've not forgotten anything.

ren
    rename files interactively
    You may change the path to your editor...
    Mine's usually /usr/bin/vim - but /bin/vi is often symlinked to that if it's installed...

ssh-agent
    Re-use existing ssh-agent
    If you have an ssh-agent running, work out its variables & set it as your environment.
    If you don't have one running, start a new one. Add a key if there isn't one loaded.

    ...and some tweaking

thin-copy
    Remove files that have been successfully copied to another location.
    I use it something like this:
        $ cp -rp orig_dir copy_dir
        $ cd orig_dir
        $ find * -type f -exec md5sum {} \; > orig
        $ cd ../copy_dir
        $ find * -type f -exec md5sum {} \;  > ../orig_dir/copy
        $ cd ../orig_dir
        $ thin-copy

thin-dir
    remove files from another directory
    Run with:
        thin-dir (path_to_other_directory)
    It will prompt you to remove any files in this directory that are a copy of a file in the other directory.
    (i.e. have the same name and md5sum)

thin-down
    remove files
    Removes duplicate files from subdirectories.
    http://snippets.dzone.com/posts/show/7871

thin-dup
    remove duplicate files
    This compares the md5sum of files and prompts to remove copies of files that are duplicated.
